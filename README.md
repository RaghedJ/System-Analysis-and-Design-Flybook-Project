# System-Analysis-and-Design-Flybook-Project
As part of the System Analysis and Design course, my team and I developed a comprehensive information system for Flybook. The goal was to apply real-world methodologies to analyze and design a functional system from the ground up.

We started by defining the project's scope and requirements through a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document following IEEE standards. This ensured clarity, structure, and alignment with industry best practices.

We then modeled the business processes using BPMN (Business Process Model and Notation) to visualize key workflows and operations within the system.

To further detail the system design, we created several UML diagrams:
- A Use Case Diagram to represent user interactions and system functionalities.
- A Sequence Diagram to illustrate the communication flow between system components.
- An Activity Diagram to map out the process logic and workflow behavior.

This project strengthened our understanding of system analysis, documentation standards, and design techniques used in software development.
